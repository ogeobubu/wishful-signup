## Description

This project is a central “bookmark” or “wishlist” that keeps all places you want to visit or things you want to buy, all in one place.

###### Technology / Language Used

CSS <br />
React

###### Challenges

One of the challenges faced in this project was the toggling of the eye icon for users to either see their password as text input or password input. This worked perfectly for the Password field, the same state in the Password field affected the Confirm Password field which caused a problem for me.

###### Features Likely to be added

_Dark theme feature_ is something I would look forward to in the future.
